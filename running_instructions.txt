### Instructions for running root_measurement code after successful installation

## step 0 - Requirements before running
# Prepare a config file like the attached config.yml file
# This needs to specify the directories of your data and intermediate files
# It must also specify the folder (config: "output_base_uri", which must be an existing folder!) into which the results (config: "output_name" folder) will go
# It also needs to give the segmentation parameter value. Start with that already in cofig file and adjust for your image to get better results.
# It must also specify the output folders into which the Venus measurement results will go
# Code can be used for ".czi" or ".lif" files by adjusting the "raw_file_type" value in the config file

## step 1 - Go to the root_measurement folder
cd root_measurement

## step 2
# Run the following commands so that the correct version of all the installed packages is accessible to root_measurement.
export PATH=$PATH:~/packages/bftools
source venv/bin/activate

## step 3 - OPTIONAL
# For Windows WSL
# in case you need to use a folder not in your home directory you need to mount it each time you restart WSL (e.g. for a hypothetical drive Z)
sudo mount -t drvfs Z: /mnt/z
# will need password

## step 4 - run the segmentation pipeline
bash segment.sh "$_dir_of_config.yml"
# Where $_dir_of_config.yml is the location of the config.yml file

## step 5 - manually curate segmentation
# Using custom software (https://github.com/jfozard/segcorrect), correct the segmentation and label cells according to cell file. Only "celltype" labels of >0 will be measured in subsequent steps.

## step 6 - run the measurement pipeline
bash measure.sh "$_dir_of_config.yml"
# Where $_dir_of_config.yml is the location of the config.yml file
